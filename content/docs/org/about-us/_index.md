**writing** is one of your best mediums to learn or share something with others. **inspired** by [Hak5](https://hak5.org/), we also intend to develop our in-house tools and payloads relevant to the security industry. **by** building such a community-driven platform, we hope all of the contents within this platform can be of good use for others to benefit from. **which** is kinda cool


{{< columns >}}
<h2>/ˈvɪʒ.ən/</h2>

**our** vision is to become one of the go-to platforms of choice for others to search similar cases or problems about infosec in general or even to try out and develop pentesting tools & payloads for our community-based arsenal

<h2>/ˈmɪʃ.ən/</h2>

**our** mission is to support the interest in publishing content for others to help the public awareness of information security in this digital world as a form of giving back to the community
